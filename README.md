# TimeWalk

## Getting Started With Platform Development

1. Clone repo
1. Open project in Unity
1. Run `Assets -> External Package Manager -> Import All`
1. Load the basic example scene showing level loading (cube prefabs) and platform UI: `\Assets\External\TimeWalk\Example\Scenes\Master.unity`
1. If there are errors it is likely the package import failed. Try downloading the packages referenced in `/Assets/packages.json` and manually importing them.
